## review

### minimum amount to structure a web page - "boilerplate code"

- declaration always in fist line of HTML files `<!DOCTYPE html>` 
- `<html>` element contains HTML code
- information about the web page belongs within `<head>`
- add title to web page by using `<title>`
- code for visible HTML content placed inside `<body>`
